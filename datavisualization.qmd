## Overview

This page presents a data visualization created during my student life.\
The visualization uses **quantitative data** and was designed to answer a specific analytical question using an appropriate graphical form.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Visualization: Relationship Between Study Hours and Exam Scores

### Context of the Task

This visualization was created for a statistics module to explore whether there is a relationship between the number of hours students spend studying and their exam performance.

The dataset contains: - **Study Hours** (number of hours studied per week) - **Exam Score** (final exam score out of 100)

The goal was to determine whether increased study time is associated with higher exam scores.

## Data Visualization

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
# Create a sample dataset
study_data <- tibble(
  study_hours = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16),
  exam_score  = c(50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85)
)

# Create the visualization
ggplot(study_data, aes(x = study_hours, y = exam_score)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Study Hours and Exam Scores",
    x = "Study Hours per Week",
    y = "Exam Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Explanation of the Visualization and Story Behind the Task

The visualization presents the relationship between **study hours per week** and **exam scores**, both of which are quantitative variables. Each point on the scatter plot represents one observation, where the x-axis shows the number of hours a student studied in a week and the y-axis shows the corresponding exam score achieved. A linear trend line is included to highlight the overall pattern in the data.

This task was carried out during a statistics module to explore how numerical data can be used to identify relationships between variables. The motivation behind the task was to understand whether increased study time has a measurable impact on academic performance, a question that is relevant to most students. Instead of relying on intuition alone, the visualization allows this relationship to be examined objectively using data.

A **scatter plot** was chosen because it is well suited for visualizing the relationship between two continuous numerical variables. It allows individual data points to be clearly seen while also revealing the overall trend. The addition of a regression line helps summarize the general direction of the relationship, making it easier to communicate the key insight that exam scores tend to increase as study hours increase.

Overall, this visualization demonstrates how quantitative data can be effectively communicated through graphical representation, enabling patterns and trends to be identified more clearly than through raw numerical data alone.
