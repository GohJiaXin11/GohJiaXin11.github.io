## Reflection on the Use of GenAI

This reflection describes my genuine experience using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools to support the completion of this assessment. GenAI was used as a **learning aid and productivity tool**, not as a replacement for my own understanding or effort.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## GenAI Tool Used and Reason for Selection

The main GenAI tool I used for this assessment was **ChatGPT**.

I chose ChatGPT because: It is easily accessible and user-friendly. It provides clear explanations for both technical and non-technical tasks. It supports multiple aspects of learning, including coding and academic writing

As a student studying Applied Computing, I found it useful for clarifying concepts and improving the structure of my work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How GenAI Supported the Completion of the Assessment

GenAI assisted me at different stages of the assessment:

-   Understanding how to structure a **Quarto (`.qmd`) file**
-   Learning how to use R libraries such as `ggplot2` for data visualization
-   Improving the clarity and coherence of written explanations

For example, when creating the data visualization page, GenAI helped me understand how to present quantitative data using a suitable graph and how to explain the rationale behind the visualization choice in an academic manner.

I reviewed and edited all generated content to ensure it aligned with my own understanding and the assessment requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Personal Reflection on Using GenAI

> “GenAI did not complete the assessment for me, but it helped me think more clearly about how to approach each task and structure my work.”

While working on this assessment, I used GenAI mainly as a **guidance and clarification tool** rather than a solution provider. When I encountered difficulties in explaining my visualization or formatting my Quarto pages, GenAI helped me identify what was missing and how to improve my presentation.

At the same time, I realised that GenAI outputs are not always perfect. In several cases, I had to adjust the wording or logic to better reflect my own understanding. This experience reinforced the importance of **critical thinking** when using GenAI tools.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Benefits of Using GenAI

Some key benefits of using GenAI include:

-   Immediate access to explanations and examples
-   Improved efficiency when completing technical tasks
-   Support for both coding and reflective writing

These benefits allowed me to focus more on learning the concepts rather than spending excessive time searching for documentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Challenges and Limitations of GenAI

Despite its advantages, GenAI also presents challenges:

-   Outputs may sometimes be inaccurate or overly general
-   There is a risk of over-reliance if used without reflection
-   Users must verify information instead of assuming correctness

This means that a basic understanding of the subject is still essential when using GenAI effectively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Future Use of GenAI in Study and Work

In future studies, I plan to use GenAI as a **supporting tool** for: - Understanding complex concepts - Debugging and reviewing code - Structuring reports and documentation

In a professional context, GenAI can assist with productivity and ideation, but responsible use will require careful evaluation of outputs and adherence to ethical and academic integrity standards.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Thoughts

Overall, my experience using GenAI for this assessment has been positive. When used responsibly, GenAI enhances learning and efficiency while still requiring active engagement and independent thinking from the user.
