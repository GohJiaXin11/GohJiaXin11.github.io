It provides clear explanations for both technical and non-technical tasks. It supports multiple aspects of learning, including coding and academic writing\nAs a student studying Applied Computing, I found it useful for clarifying concepts and improving the structure of my work."

When I encountered difficulties in explaining my visualization or formatting my Quarto pages, GenAI helped me identify what was missing and how to improve my presentation.\nAt the same time, I realised that GenAI outputs are not always perfect. In several cases, I had to adjust the wording or logic to better reflect my own understanding. This experience reinforced the importance of critical thinking when using GenAI tools."

Each point on the scatter plot represents one observation, where the x-axis shows the number of hours a student studied in a week and the y-axis shows the corresponding exam score achieved. A linear trend line is included to highlight the overall pattern in the data.\nThis task was carried out during a statistics module to explore how numerical data can be used to identify relationships between variables. The motivation behind the task was to understand whether increased study time has a measurable impact on academic performance, a question that is relevant to most students. Instead of relying on intuition alone, the visualization allows this relationship to be examined objectively using data.\nA scatter plot was chosen because it is well suited for visualizing the relationship between two continuous numerical variables. It allows individual data points to be clearly seen while also revealing the overall trend. The addition of a regression line helps summarize the general direction of the relationship, making it easier to communicate the key insight that exam scores tend to increase as study hours increase.\nOverall, this visualization demonstrates how quantitative data can be effectively communicated through graphical representation, enabling patterns and trends to be identified more clearly than through raw numerical data alone."
