title: "Final Year Project: Honeypot_Studio A Distributed Cyber Threat Detection System  "
---

## 🔍 Project Background
In my final year at SIT, I developed **Honeypot_Studio**, a distributed honeypot system designed to detect and analyze real-world cyber attacks. The project was inspired by the rising need for practical threat intelligence in academic and small-scale organizational networks.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate vulnerable services across multiple nodes to attract attackers
- Collect and centralize attack logs for analysis
- Visualize attack patterns in real-time
- Provide actionable insights for cybersecurity training

## 🛠 Implementation
The system integrates:
- **Cowrie** (SSH honeypot)
- **Dionaea** (malware capture)
- **Elastic Stack** for log aggregation and dashboards
- **Python scripts** for automation and alerting

## 📊 Outcomes
- Successfully captured over 1,000 attack attempts in a 2-week deployment
- Identiated common attack vectors (brute-force SSH, IoT exploits)
- Delivered a working dashboard for real-time monitoring

## 🔗 Repository

## 🧠 Reflection
Building this project deepened my understanding of:
- Network security monitoring
- Attack attribution and log analysis
- The importance of deception in cyber defense

> “Security is not just about defense—it’s about understanding the attacker.” – My takeaway from this project.
